task 01: Create a frontend app in React(19) using nodejs(24) and vite(latest).

Do not use statement management libraries like Redux or MobX.
Do not comment the code.

About the UI we should have 3 pages:
* welcome: this is the first page and just has a welcome message.
* map: should DRAW the map of brazil and each state name of people should show on the map(get from baackend localhost:8080/mappings).
* add: where we should be ablle to add people to states or new states.

Make sure you add tests and tests are passing.
Make sure the frontend code is on the frontend/src/ folder.
Make sure frontend pages have validations and error handling.
Make sure frontend is always calling backend on localhost:8080/.
Make sure frontend running on port 3000.

Please use the following backend endpoints:

To list all states and people:
GET /mappings where it will retun a json like this:
{
    "states:": [
        {
            "name": "SC",
            "people": [
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "Developer X",
                    "expertise": "Backend"
                },
                {
                   "id": 2,
                    "name": "Developer Y",
                    "expertise": "Frontend"
                },
                {
                    "id": 3,
                    "name": "Developer Z",
                    "expertise": "DevOps"
                }
            ],
        },
        {
            "name": "NY",
            "people": [
                {
                    "id": 4,
                    "name": "Developer A",
                    "expertise": "Backend"
                },
                {
                    "id": 5,
                    "name": "Developer B",
                    "expertise": "Frontend"
                },
                {
                    "id": 6,
                    "name": "Developer C",
                    "expertise": "DevOps"
                }
            ]
        }
   ]
}

To create a new state or person:
POST /mappings where it will accept a json like this:
{
    "name": "TX",
    "people": [
        {
            "id": 7,
            "name": "Developer D",
            "expertise": "Backend"
        },
        {
            "id": 8,
            "name": "Developer E",
            "expertise": "Frontend"
        },
        {
            "id": 9,
            "name": "Developer F",
            "expertise": "DevOps"
        }
    ]
}
